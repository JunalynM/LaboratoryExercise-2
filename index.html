    <h3>History</h3> 
    <p>Its inception, House Bill No. 5638, was ardently pushed by Representatives Edgar M. Chatto, Roberto C. Cajes, and Adam Relson L. Jala of the First, Second, Third Districts respectively and by its First President, Dr. Elpidio T. Magante.</p>
    <p>Being the realization of the Boholano aspiration, the Bohol Island State University is mandated to primarily provide advanced education, engineering, agriculture, fisheries, environment, arts and sciences, accountancy, cooperative, business and entrepreneurship, technology, and other relevant fields of study.</p>
    <p>The birth of BISU also gave birth to its sixth and youngest satellite campus. The Balilihan Campus was formerly an extension class of the Tagbilaran City Campus which started accepting enrollees in the First Semester of A.Y. 2006-2007. R.A. 9722, the same law that converted CVSCAFT to BISU, categorically declared Balilihan as one of the satellite campuses of BISU.</p>
